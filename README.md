## Folder: **Descriptors&Classification**
This folder contains the following key files:

### Descriptors.csv
This file includes the descriptor values for all systems. The data sources are:

The PubChem 2025 database:
Kim, S., Chen, J., Cheng, T., et al. (2025). PubChem 2025 update. Nucleic Acids Res., 53(D1), D1516–D1525.

Our own DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations.

### SeparateByGroup.ipynb
A Python notebook that randomly splits the dataset into training and prediction sets.
Dependencies: Requires the pandas library.

## Folder: **CNN**
This folder contains the model of CNN.

### Eb.ipynb, Ec.ipynb, and Ef.ipynb
Three Jupyter notebooks—Eb.ipynb, Ec.ipynb, and Ef.ipynb—which correspond to the training of CNN models for predicting binding energy, cohesive energy, and formation energy, respectively. Each notebook includes:

Model training parameters

Evaluation metrics such as MRSE, MEA, and R²

Performance comparison between CNN predictions and DFT results on both training and test datasets

SHAP analysis for interpreting model predictions

### Eb.h5, Ec.h5

The files Eb.h5, Ec.h5, and Ef.h5 are the trained CNN models corresponding to the three energy types above.

## Folder: **ML**
This folder shows various methods for predicting Binding Energy (Eb), Cohesive Energy (Ec), and Formation Energy (Eform)
